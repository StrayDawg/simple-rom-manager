# Simple ROM Manager

A command-line tool for verifying game ROMS against published ROM set DAT files. In other words, a simple implementation of tools like [ClrMamePro](https://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/).

## About

If you're into collecting ROMs for old game consoles you may be aware there are some published lists of "blessed" ROM files that when combined make a complete set. [No-Intro](http://no-intro.org/) is one of these groups and they publish their ROM set data for many consoles on their [Dat-O-Matic](http://datomatic.no-intro.org/) site.

Simple ROM Manager (SRM) can be used to quickly manage ROMs you have collected by confirming ROMs that are _good_, _bad_, and _missing_.
