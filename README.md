A command-line tool for verifying console and arcade ROMs against published ROM set DAT files.

The goal of this tool is to implementation the verification and file management features found in [ClrMamePro](https://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/).

## About

There are a few groups that publish metadata for ROMs of legacy game systems and arcades. In some cases the data is simply a "best-of" list of ROM files that when combined make a complete set. For emulators like [MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/releases) ([split](https://github.com/libretro/fbalpha/tree/master/dats)) or [FBA](https://github.com/libretro/fbalpha/tree/master/dats), a ROM may not work correct when used with older versions of ROMs.

[No-Intro](http://no-intro.org/) is one groups that publish ROM set data for many consoles on their [Dat-O-Matic](http://datomatic.no-intro.org/) site.

Simple ROM Manager (SRM) can be used to quickly manage ROMs in a collection by confirming ROMs that are _good_, _bad_, and _missing_ and by renaming and/or re-packaging the files.
